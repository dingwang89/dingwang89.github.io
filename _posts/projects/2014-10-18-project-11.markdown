description: In this MSc Design Ethnography project, we were working in conjunction with the Microsoft Office Envisioning team to explore self-tracking behaviour, and the meaning of ‘self’ and ‘quantification’ in the sociocultural context of Brazil. This is part of a bigger project where other teams studied quantified self movement in China, India and Europe. In the end of this project I was in charge of organising the ideation workshop where we came together to compare and contrast how people from different sociocultural context approached self-tracking and the securities issues such as privacy and trust differently.
