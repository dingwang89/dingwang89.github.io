description: This project envisions a renewable energy future where free trade between micro-generators is enabled through a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market. In the first phase of this project, we conducted a landscape study with different market players in the current energy market in UK taking part in the renewable energy generating and trading. Through the understanding and examinations of the current challenges and opportunities in policy, infrastructure, and technology, a novel technical platform to support P2P household-level energy trading is proposed.
