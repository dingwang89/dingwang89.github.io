description: Unpacking the smart city is a brief summary of my doctoral thesis project which explores the discourses of smart cities. I am especially interested in how these discourses affect smart city research practices and knowledge production in academic institutions, industry research and development context as well as in policy making process. Through a Foucauldian perspective, I have mapped out the trajectory of how experts produced knowledge of the smart cities and how this knowledge production process helped them to establish power and subjectivity.
